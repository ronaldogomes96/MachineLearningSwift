# Keats Or Yeats

Keats Or Yeats is a project developed to study the creation of a natural language coreML model with turi create.

First, a python code is created with turi create to create the coreML model, which is exported. This model predicts, based on a sentence, who the author would be. A database with several phrases by well-known authors is used for its creation.

After that, a project is done in xcode that receives a sentence and returns the possible author of it.
