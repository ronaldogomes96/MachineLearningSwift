# Advertising

Advertising is a project that focuses on the use of coremltools, which is a framework that allows you to convert third-party library models to the Core ML format. 

In this project, the coreML model is done first in python, using the Scikit-learn library.

The model consists of predicting the number of sales according to the means of publication, in this case the number of radio, TV and newspaper ads. The linear regression algorithm is used. The model is then exported to coreML using coremltools.

The Xcode project consists of choosing these variables to obtain the possible number of sales as a result.

These folders contain the project and Python code and the database.
