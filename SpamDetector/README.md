# Spam Detector
Spam Detector is a playground for CreateML studies, but without using its graphical interface, but using codes in the playground.

It consists of the creation of a coreMl model for the classification of message texts that may or may not be spam. A database with multiple messages is used with these catalogs.

The model is created via playground. Sometimes this is necessary when we want a more customizable model, because via code we have more freedom, to change metrics, to divide the database and so on. CreateML allows this, being able to be used both in its graphical interface and via playground, obtaining the same res.
