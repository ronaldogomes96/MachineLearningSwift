# Machine Learning Swift
This repository contains projects developed for the documentation of the swift machine learning study.

These are projects originating from tutorials on the internet, books and own attempts.

So far, the following structures and technologies are used:
- Swift
- CoreML
- CreateML
- Vision
- Turi Create
- Natural Language
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Coremltools

Click on each of the project folders for more information.

As this repository is for study and on such a vast subject, I intend to continue placing projects, using new technologies and frameworks, showing more and more the power that Swift applications have over Machine Learning.

## How to use?
### Xcode Project
You can clone the project using:

git clone https://github.com/ronaldogomes96/MachineLearningSwift.git

After that, just run the one project in the simulator itself.
