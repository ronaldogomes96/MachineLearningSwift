# See Food

See Food is an iOS application made for vision studies along with coreML for image classification.

This project was developed with the objective of recognizing objects and food through images of photos. The Inceptionv3 pre-trained model is used, which detects the dominant objects present in an image from a set of 1000 categories such as trees, animals, food, vehicles, person, etc., and is made with neural networks. It receives the image as an input and from it returns a series of possible responses. The application consists of choosing a photo and getting the answer of what it is. Image processing is done with Vision and the use of the model with CoreML. As it is an external and well-trained model, its success rate when using the application is very high.
