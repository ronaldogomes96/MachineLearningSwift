# Twittermenti

Twittermenti is an application developed during this [swiff course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/). 

Its objective is the general study of apple tools for Machine Learning, CoreML and CreateML, for creating an NLP model.

It was first created the CoreMl model through CreateML in the playgrounds, as it allows for greater customization of NLP. Then the project was done in Ccode, using CoreML.

In addition to the ML content, the use of pods and the use of the twitter's api were also learned.

Finally, the app receives a word and returns how twitter users are feeling about that word, through emoticons. For example, if the word is being spoken very well, with positive comments, then the happy emoticon will be shown. The reverse also applies. It performs the sentiment analysis process at each user interaction, searching for data in the twitter api.
