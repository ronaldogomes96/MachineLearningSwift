# CreateMl Tutorial Get Started

This project is based on the [raywenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/5653-create-ml-tutorial-getting-started) tutorial on CreateML

It is used in the playground to recognize the type of animal from images, comparing the creation of the model with 100 images and 1000 images. During the tutorial it is shown how the different choice of parameters works and how they influence the final result.

It also shows how turi create works, which aims to simplify the development of customized machine learning models. The code is done in python on the jupyter notebook.

Then, a test project of this coreML model is done in xcode, which tries to classify the image of animals using the Vision framework.
