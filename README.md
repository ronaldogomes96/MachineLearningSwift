# Machine Learning Swift
This repository contains projects developed for the documentation of the swift machine learning study.

These are projects originating from tutorials on the internet, books and own attempts.

So far, the following structures and technologies are used:
- Swift
- CoreML
- CreateML
- Vision
- Turi Create
- Natural Language
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Coremltools

Click on each of the project folders for more information.

As this repository is for study and on such a vast subject, I intend to continue placing projects, using new technologies and frameworks, showing more and more the power that Swift applications have over Machine Learning.

## How to use?

This project uses `Git LFS` to upload CoreML models (.mlmodel files).

To be able to download this project and use the templates contained in it, first

1. Normally clone the repository

> SSH: `git clone git@github.com:ronaldogomes96/MachineLearningSwift.git`
>
> HTML: `git clone https://github.com/ronaldogomes96/MachineLearningSwift.git`

2. Download [Git LFS] (https://git-lfs.github.com) on your Mac

> `brew install git-lfs`

3. After installing Git LFS, through the terminal, enter the project's repository folder, and execute:

> `git lfs install`

> `git lfs pull`

At that point, the templates will be downloaded to the cloned repository. Once the download is complete, you can open the project and use it normally.
